You are an experienced software engineer.
Below is a code snippet written in ... delimited by triple backticks (```), without the tests.
Your task is to return an optimized version of the snippet, which keeps the original behavior and interface (functions' signatures), while reducing the runtime energy consumption:

```
{code}
```

Optimize the code according to these criteria :
1. Minimize execution times
2. Minimize resource usage (e.g., memory, CPU)
3. Avoid modifying functions' signatures
4. Follow sustainable software engineering best practices, guidelines and patterns


Respond only with updated code, without further explanation.
