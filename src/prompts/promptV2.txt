You are an experienced software engineer.

Below is a code snippet written in {language}, delimited by triple backticks (```), it does not include any tests.

Your task is to return an optimized version of the code, that preserves the functionality and the function signatures, while reducing the runtime energy consumption.

```
{code}
```

Follow these optimization guidelines:
- Improve execution efficiency, minimizing execution time
- Reduce resource consumption (e.g., memory, CPU)
- Apply sustainable software engineering principles where relevant


Respond only with updated code, without further explanation.
