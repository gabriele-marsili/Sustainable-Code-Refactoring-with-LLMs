      ✓ Smallest perfect number is classified correctly (2 ms)
      ✓ Medium perfect number is classified correctly (2 ms)
      ✓ Large perfect number is classified correctly
    Abundant Numbers
      ✓ Smallest abundant number is classified correctly
      ✓ Medium abundant number is classified correctly (1 ms)
      ✓ Large abundant number is classified correctly
    Deficient Numbers
      ✓ Smallest prime deficient number is classified correctly
      ✓ Smallest non-prime deficient number is classified correctly (2 ms)
      ✓ Medium deficient number is classified correctly (1 ms)
      ✓ Large deficient number is classified correctly (3 ms)
      ✕ Edge case (no factors other than itself) is classified correctly (4 ms)
    Invalid Inputs
      ✓ Zero is rejected (not a natural number)
      ✓ Negative integer is rejected (not a natural number)
