  run-length encode a string
    ✓ encode empty string (47 ms)
    ✓ single characters only are encoded without count (1 ms)
    ✓ encode string with no single characters (8 ms)
    ✓ encode string with single characters mixed with repeated characters (1 ms)
    ✓ encode string with multiple whitespaces (4 ms)
    ✓ encode string with lowercase characters (16 ms)
  run-length decode a string
