    ○ skipped is reversible
  Incorrect key cipher
    ○ skipped throws an error with an all caps key
    ○ skipped throws an error with a numeric key
    ○ skipped throws an error with an empty key
  Substitution cipher
    ○ skipped keeps the submitted key
    ○ skipped can encode
    ○ skipped can decode
    ○ skipped is reversible
    ○ skipped : double shift encode
    ○ skipped can wrap
