    ✓ pop gets last element from the list (156 ms)
    ✓ push/pop respectively add/remove at the end of the list (4 ms)
    ✓ shift gets element from the list (4 ms)
    ✓ shift gets first element from the list (1 ms)

    ○ skipped deletes the element with the specified value from the list
    ○ skipped deletes the element with the specified value from the list, re-assigns tail
    ○ skipped deletes the element with the specified value from the list, re-assigns head
