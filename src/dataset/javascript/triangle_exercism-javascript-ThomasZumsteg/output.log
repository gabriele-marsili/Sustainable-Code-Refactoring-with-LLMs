PASS ./triangle_testSuite.js
  Triangle
    ✓ equilateral triangles have equal sides (1 ms)
    ✓ larger equilateral triangles also have equal sides (1 ms)
    ✓ isosceles triangles have last two sides equal
    ✓ isosceles trianges have first and last sides equal
    ✓ isosceles triangles have two first sides equal
    ✓ isosceles triangles have in fact exactly two sides equal
    ✓ scalene triangles have no equal sides
    ✓ scalene triangles have no equal sides at a larger scale too (1 ms)
    ✓ scalene triangles have no equal sides in descending order either
    ✓ very small triangles are legal
    ✓ test triangles with no size are illegal
    ✓ triangles with negative sides are illegal
    ✓ triangles violating triangle inequality are illegal (1 ms)
    ✓ edge cases of triangle inequality are in fact legal
    ✓ triangles violating triangle inequality are illegal 2
