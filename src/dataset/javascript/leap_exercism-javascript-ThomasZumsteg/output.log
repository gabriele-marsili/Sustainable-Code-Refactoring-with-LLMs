PASS ./leap_testSuite.js
  Leap year
    ✓ is not very common (1 ms)
    ✓ is introduced every 4 years to adjust about a day
    ✓ is skipped every 100 years to remove an extra day
    ✓ is reintroduced every 400 years to adjust another day
    Additional example of a leap year that
      ○ skipped is not a leap year
      ○ skipped is a common leap year
      ○ skipped is skipped every 100 years
      ○ skipped is reintroduced every 400 years
