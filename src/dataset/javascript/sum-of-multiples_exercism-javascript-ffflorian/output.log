PASS ./sum-of-multiples_testSuite.js
  Sum Of Multiples
    ✓ no multiples within limit (2 ms)
    ✓ one factor has multiples within limit
    ✓ more than one multiple within limit
    ✓ more than one factor with multiples within limit (1 ms)
    ✓ each multiple is only counted once
    ✓ a much larger limit (1 ms)
    ✓ three factors
    ✓ factors not relatively prime
    ✓ some pairs of factors relatively prime and some not
    ✓ one factor is a multiple of another
    ✓ much larger factors
    ✓ all numbers are multiples of 1
    ✓ no factors means an empty sum
    ✓ the only multiple of 0 is 0 (1 ms)
    ✓ the factor 0 does not affect the sum of multiples of other factors
    ✓ solutions using include-exclude must extend to cardinality greater than 3 (10 ms)
