  School
    ✓ a new school has an empty roster (3 ms)
    ✓ adding a student adds them to the roster for the given grade
    ✓ adding more students to the same grade adds them to the roster
    ✓ adding students to different grades adds them to the roster
    ✓ grade returns the students in that grade in alphabetical order (1 ms)
    ✓ grade returns an empty array if there are no students in that grade
    ✕ the students names in each grade in the roster are sorted (3 ms)
    ✕ roster cannot be modified outside of module
    ✓ roster cannot be modified outside of module using grade()
    ✕ a student can't be in two different grades
