  A leap year
    ✓ year not divisible by 4 in common year (62 ms)
    ✓ year divisible by 2, not divisible by 4 in common year (2 ms)
    ✕ year divisible by 4, not divisible by 100 in leap year (25 ms)
    ✕ year divisible by 4 and 5 is still a leap year (2 ms)
    ✓ year divisible by 100, not divisible by 400 in common year (1 ms)
    ✓ year divisible by 100 but not by 3 is still not a leap year (2 ms)
    ✓ year divisible by 400 in leap year (3 ms)
    ✓ year divisible by 400 but not by 125 is still a leap year (3 ms)
    ✓ year divisible by 200, not divisible by 400 in common year (4 ms)
