PASS ./run-length-encoding_testSuite.js
  run-length encode a string
    ✓ encode empty string (2 ms)
    ✓ single characters only are encoded without count
    ✓ encode string with no single characters
    ✓ encode string with single characters mixed with repeated characters
    ✓ encode string with multiple whitespaces (1 ms)
    ✓ encode string with lowercase characters
  run-length decode a string
    ✓ decode empty string
    ✓ decode string with single characters only
    ✓ decode string with no single characters (1 ms)
    ✓ decode string with single characters mixed with repeated characters
    ✓ decode string with multiple whitespaces
    ✓ decode string with lowercase characters (1 ms)
  run-length encode and then decode
    ✓ encode followed by decode gives original string
