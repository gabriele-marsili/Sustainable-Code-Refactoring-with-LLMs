  CustomSet
    empty: returns true if the set contains no elements
      ✓ sets with no elements are empty (4 ms)
      ✓ sets with elements are not empty
    contains: sets can report if they contain an element
      ✓ nothing is contained in an empty set
      ✓ when the element is in the set
      ✓ when the element is not in the set (3 ms)
    subset: a set is a subset if all of its elements are contained in the other set
      ✓ empty set is a subset of another empty set
      ✓ empty set is a subset of non-empty set
      ✓ non-empty set is not a subset of empty set
      ✓ set is a subset of set with exact same elements
      ✓ set is a subset of larger set with same elements (1 ms)
      ✓ set is not a subset of set that does not contain its elements
    disjoint: sets are disjoint if they share no elements
      ✓ the empty set is disjoint with itself
      ✓ empty set is disjoint with non-empty set
      ✓ non-empty set is disjoint with empty set (1 ms)
      ✓ sets are not disjoint if they share an element

    eql: sets with the same elements are equal
      ✓ empty sets are equal
      ✓ empty set is not equal to non-empty set
      ✓ non-empty set is not equal to empty set
      ✓ sets with the same elements are equal
      ✓ sets with different elements are not equal
    add: unique elements can be added to a set
      ✓ add to empty set
      ✓ add to non-empty set
      ✓ adding an existing element does not change the set (51 ms)
    intersection: returns a set of all shared elements
      ✓ intersection of two empty sets is an empty set (1 ms)
      ✓ intersection of an empty set and non-empty set is an empty set
      ✓ intersection of a non-empty set and an empty set is an empty set
      ✓ intersection of two sets with no shared elements is an empty set
      ✓ intersection of two sets with shared elements is a set of the shared elements
    difference of a set is a set of all elements that are only in the first set
      ✓ difference of two empty sets is an empty set
      ✓ difference of empty set and non-empty set is an empty set
      ✓ difference of a non-empty set and an empty set is the non-empty set
      ✓ difference of two non-empty sets is a set of elements that are only in the first set
    union: returns a set of all elements in either set
      ✓ union of empty sets is an empty set
      ✓ union of an empty set and non-empty set is the non-empty set
      ✓ union of a non-empty set and empty set is the non-empty set
      ✓ union of non-empty sets contains all unique elements (1 ms)
