    Measure using bucket one of size 3 and bucket two of size 5
      ✓ start with bucket one (160 ms)
      ✓ start with bucket two (13 ms)
    Measure using bucket one of size 7 and bucket two of size 11
      ✓ start with bucket one (9 ms)
      ✓ start with bucket two (6 ms)
    Measure one step using bucket one of size 1 and bucket two of size 3
      ✓ start with bucket two (4 ms)
    Measure using bucket one of size 2 and bucket two of size 3
      ○ skipped start with bucket one and end with bucket two
    Reachability
      ✓ With the same buckets but a different goal, then it is possible (4 ms)
      ○ skipped Not possible to reach the goal
    Goal larger than both buckets
      ○ skipped Is impossible
