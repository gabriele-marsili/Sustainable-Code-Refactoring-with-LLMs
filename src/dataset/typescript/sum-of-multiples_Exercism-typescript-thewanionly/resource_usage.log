  Sum Of Multiples
    ✓ no multiples within limit (154 ms)
    ✓ one factor has multiples within limit (5 ms)
    ✓ more than one multiple within limit (43 ms)
    ✓ more than one factor with multiples within limit (2 ms)
    ✓ each multiple is only counted once (28 ms)
    ✓ a much larger limit (3 ms)
    ✓ three factors (6 ms)
    ✓ factors not relatively prime (5 ms)
    ✓ some pairs of factors relatively prime and some not (11 ms)
    ✓ one factor is a multiple of another (9 ms)
    ✓ much larger factors (221 ms)
    ✓ all numbers are multiples of 1 (17 ms)
    ✓ no factors means an empty sum (19 ms)
    ✓ the only multiple of 0 is 0 (7 ms)
    ✓ the factor 0 does not affect the sum of multiples of other factors (242 ms)
