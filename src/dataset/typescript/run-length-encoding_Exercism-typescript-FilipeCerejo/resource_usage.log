FAIL ./run-length-encoding.test.ts
  run-length encode a string
    ✓ empty string (1 ms)
    ✓ single characters only are encoded without count
    ✓ string with no single characters
    ✓ single characters mixed with repeated characters
    ✓ multiple whitespace mixed in string
    ✓ lowercase characters
  run-length decode a string
    ✓ empty string
    ✓ single characters only
    ✓ string with no single characters
    ✓ single characters with repeated characters
    ✕ multiple whitespace mixed in string
    ✓ lower case string
  encode and then decode
    ✕ encode followed by decode gives original string (1 ms)
