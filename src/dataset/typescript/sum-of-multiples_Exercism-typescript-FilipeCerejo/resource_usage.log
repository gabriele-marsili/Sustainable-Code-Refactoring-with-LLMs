  Sum Of Multiples
    ✓ no multiples within limit (1 ms)
    ○ skipped one factor has multiples within limit
    ○ skipped more than one multiple within limit
    ○ skipped more than one factor with multiples within limit
    ○ skipped each multiple is only counted once
    ○ skipped a much larger limit
    ○ skipped three factors
    ○ skipped factors not relatively prime
    ○ skipped some pairs of factors relatively prime and some not
    ○ skipped one factor is a multiple of another
    ○ skipped much larger factors
    ○ skipped all numbers are multiples of 1
    ○ skipped no factors means an empty sum
    ○ skipped the only multiple of 0 is 0
    ○ skipped the factor 0 does not affect the sum of multiples of other factors
    ○ skipped solutions using include-exclude must extend to cardinality greater than 3
