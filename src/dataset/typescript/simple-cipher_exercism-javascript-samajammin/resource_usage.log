  Random key generation
    ✓ generates keys at random (1 ms)
  Random key cipher
    ✓ has a key made of letters
    ✓ has a key that is at least 100 characters long
    ✓ can encode
    ✓ can decode (1 ms)
    ✓ is reversible
  Incorrect key cipher
    ✓ throws an error with an all caps key (10 ms)
    ✓ throws an error with a mixed case key (1 ms)
    ✓ throws an error with a numeric key
    ✓ throws an error with an empty key (1 ms)
  Substitution cipher
    ✓ keeps the submitted key
    ✓ can encode
    ✓ can decode
    ✓ is reversible
    ✓ : double shift encode
    ✓ can wrap on encode
    ✓ can wrap on decode (3 ms)
    ✓ can handle messages longer than the key (encode)
    ✓ can handle messages longer than the key (decode)
