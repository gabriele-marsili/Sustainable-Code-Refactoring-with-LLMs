    ○ skipped generates keys at random
  Random key cipher
    ✓ has a key made of letters (89 ms)
    ○ skipped has a key that is at least 100 characters long
    ○ skipped can encode
    ○ skipped can decode
    ○ skipped is reversible
  Substitution cipher
    ○ skipped keeps the submitted key
    ○ skipped can encode
    ○ skipped can decode
    ○ skipped is reversible
    ○ skipped : double shift encode
    ○ skipped can wrap on encode
    ○ skipped can wrap on decode
    ○ skipped can encode messages longer than the key"
    ○ skipped can decode messages longer than the key
