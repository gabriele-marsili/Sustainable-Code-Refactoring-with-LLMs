    ✓ compute cells update value when inputs are changed (54 ms)
    ○ skipped input cells have a value
    ○ skipped an input cell's value can be set
    ○ skipped compute cells calculate initial value
    ○ skipped compute cell takes inputs in correct order
    ○ skipped compute cells can depend on other compute cells
    ○ skipped compute cells fire callbacks
    ○ skipped callbacks fire only when output values change
    ○ skipped callbacks do not report already reported values
    ○ skipped callbacks can fire from multiple cells
    ○ skipped static callbacks fire even if their own value has not changed
    ○ skipped callbacks can be added and removed
    ○ skipped removing a callback multiple times doesn't interfere with other callbacks
    ○ skipped callbacks should only be called once, even if multiple dependencies change
    ○ skipped callbacks should not be called if dependencies change but output value doesn't change
