#include "bob.h"

// Assuming bob.h declares a class or functions, but since no implementation is provided,
// we ensure minimal includes and avoid unnecessary code to reduce energy consumption.

// If bob.h contains class/function declarations, ensure they are used efficiently.
// No additional code is added to avoid unnecessary computation or memory usage.
