You are an experienced software engineer.
Below is a code snippet delimited by triple backticks (```), without the tests.
Your task is to return the same optimized snippet, maintaining the original behavior (compatibility with the test suite):

```
{code}
```

Optimize the code according to these criteria, in order of priority:
1. Efficiency and speed of execution
2. Minimal resource use (e.g., memory)
3. Sustainability of maintenance and execution
4. Software engineering best practices

Respond only with updated code, without further explanation.
